To use our projet, open Matlab or import all the *.m files in your folder. 

Launch "Projet.m" to hear our melody and uncomment all audiowrite commands down at the bottom to create .wav files to listen to different parts of the melody externely.

Please feel free to read our report 'CompteRendu_Anthony_Duc.docx.pdf' for more explanation (only in French at the time :) )
